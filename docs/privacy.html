        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="meta"><strong>Effective date:</strong> February 23, 2026</p>

        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how Multiply Rush ("the Game") handles information.
          Multiply Rush is an offline game and is built to minimize data collection.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          We do not collect personal information through the Game.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>No account registration is required.</li>
          <li>No analytics or ad tracking SDKs are used in normal gameplay.</li>
          <li>No in-app purchase SDK is used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Game may store local gameplay settings and progress on your device (for example, options and progression state).
          This local data stays on your device unless you delete the app or back up your device through platform tools.
        </p>

        <h2>2. How Information Is Used</h2>
        <p>
          Local data is used only to operate game features such as saved preferences and progression.
          It is not sent to us by the Game.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          The Game is intended to run without third-party advertising, analytics, or commerce services.
          If this changes in a future release, this policy will be updated before that release.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Network Use</h2>
        <p>
          Multiply Rush is designed for offline play and does not require an active internet connection for core gameplay.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Because we do not collect personal information through the Game, we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Data stored by the Game on your device remains until you remove it (for example, by deleting app data or uninstalling the app).
        </p>

        <h2>7. Changes To This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy when product behavior changes. The updated version will be posted on this page with a new effective date.
        </p>
